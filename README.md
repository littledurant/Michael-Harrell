Michael Harrell definition of integrity 
It is important because academic integrity grants credibility and maintains a good reputation in higher learning institutions such that their qualifications are credible and deserving. They ensure that students' knowledge and abilities are put to test by professors on equal terms. It also installs values such as honesty, responsibility, and ethical behavior in the minds of the students, which would be helpful in academics and beyond into professional and personal life. They also contribute to a culture of trust and respect within academic circles.
