Step1:
Define the Game Logic
The game involves generating a random number within a specified range and allowing the user to guess this number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.


Step2:
Generate Random Number
Use a random number generator to select a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100). This ensures that each game session starts with a different target number.


Step3:
User Input and Validation
Prompt the user to input their guess. Validate the input to ensure it is numeric and within the specified range. If the input is invalid, prompt the user again.


Step4:
Compare Guess with Target
Compare the user's guess to the randomly generated number. Provide feedback:

"too high" if the guess is greater, "too low" if less, and "correct" if it matches.

Step5:
Repeat Until Correct
Continue prompting the user for guesses until they correctly identify the number. Each incorrect guess should be followed by appropriate feedback.


Step6:
End Game
Once the correct number is guessed, end the game and optionally provide the user with the option to play again or exit.

A[Start] --> B[Generate Random Number]
B --> C[Prompt User for Guess]
C --> D{Is Input Valid?}
D -- No --> C
D -- Yes --> E{Compare Guess with Target}
E -- Too High --> F[Feedback: Too High]
E -- Too Low --> G[Feedback: Too Low]
E -- Correct --> H[Feedback: Correct]
F --> C
G --> C
H --> I{Play Again?}
I -- Yes --> B
I -- No --> J[End]
